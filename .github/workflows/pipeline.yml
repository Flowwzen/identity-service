# Name of this pipeline shown in GitHub Actions
name: NodeJS CI Pipeline

# When should the pipeline run?
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]           # Run on every push to main
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]           # Run for pull requests into main
  workflow_dispatch:             # Run manually from GitHub Actions

# All tasks inside the pipeline are called "jobs"
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest        # Uses a Linux runner provided by GitHub

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get your code from the repository
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js (choose version you use in your project)
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"      # You can use 18, 20, or 21

      # Step 3: Install dependencies from package-lock.json
      # npm ci is better for CI pipelines than npm install (faster/cleaner)
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Run linting to check code quality
      # This only works if you have "npm run lint" in package.json
      - name: Run Linter
        run: npm run lint
        continue-on-error: true   # Does not stop pipeline if lint fails for now

      # Step 5: Run tests to make sure project works
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test

      # Step 6: Build the project (only required if using TypeScript or a build step)
      - name: Build Project
        run: npm run build
        if: hashFiles('tsconfig.json') != ''   # Runs only if tsconfig exists

      # Step 7: Show success message
      - name: Completed
        run: echo "🎉 CI Pipeline finished successfully!"
